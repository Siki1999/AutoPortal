# AutoPortal - ASP.NET
I created an application in ASP.NET for displaying cars with technical specifications with the possibility of contract meetings.

The cars were stored in a database.

Ability to log in to the application.

Admin has the ability to add new cars, delete existing ones, change specifications, view all appointments and a lot more.

Users have the option of arranging meetings, at what hours and on which day the user wishes, the ability to create a pdf with car model, image and technical specifications.
